UnifyJS, (C) Copyright 2011, Alexander Wilden (october dot rust at gmx dot de)

UnifyJS is a very simple helper that unifies multiple asynchronous function calls in
one wrapper. This wrapper allows to call a single callback when all of the functions
have done their work, i.e. called their callbacks.

As examples say more than words there can be found one here: http://jsfiddle.net/HfPAT/

If that's not sufficient, here is some more text:
(And if that's still not sufficient don't hesitate to contact me ;-))

The only Object supplied by this library is Unify. You can call add() on it for as
many asynchronous functions that should be called. add() expects at least two parameters:

1. the asynchronous function object to invoke
2. the position marker (Unify.CALLBACK) for the unify mechanism to inject its internal callback

This is sufficient for all asynchronous functions that just need to have a callback as
input parameter. Functions without any callback are not possible as their would be no
way for unify to inject itself.

So for this simple case it could look like this:

Unify.add( myAsyncFunction, Unify.CALLBACK );

If the function expects another parameter at the first position or some after the callback
this could look like this:

Unify.add( myAsyncFunction, firstArgument, Unify.CALLBACK, thirdArgument, forthArgument );

It is even possible to have a function that expects different callbacks for different outcomes.
Yet it should be noted (and perhaps clear), that unify cannot directly react on these
outcomes and interpret them. This has to been done after invocation.
A simple case could be this:

Unify.add( myAsyncFunction, firstArgument, Unify.CALLBACK, Unify.CALLBACK );

As add() returns the unified object multiple asynchronous functions are chained via add and
directly invoked with the function that should be called when all asynchronous functions are
done:

Unify.add( myAsyncFunction, Unify.CALLBACK )
     .add( myAsyncFunction, firstArgument, Unify.CALLBACK, thirdArgument, forthArgument )
     .add( myAsyncFunction, firstArgument, Unify.CALLBACK, Unify.CALLBACK );
     .invoke( function( results ) {
        // do something with the results
     } );
